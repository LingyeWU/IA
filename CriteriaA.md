# Catalysm Task Tracker
### Defining the problem

Given the current situation of the corona virus, my client, the school magazine club Catalysm,
is looking for a software that helps coordinate the on-site and off-site members of the club. The club needs a software including functions such as task tracker, 
email reminder, assigning tasks, and noteboard. They also want to be able to connect all their work in one place and bring teams together, anywhere. From lists to boards, to calendars and gantt charts, organize work their way. They specifically want this software to be accessible from laptops and phones, and 
directly connects to their school emails. 

Accoding to my client, the software should only be accessible by the members of the club and giving different administrative level to the club leader,
club admin, club supervisor, and the club members. (see more in Success Criteria)

### Solution proposed
In order to meet Catalysm's demand for this software, I have specifically chosen Python and QT designer as the major development tools, github as the docomentation
platform for any updates, recodings, tasks, journal, and process. In the process, the QT designer will allow me to design a basic User Interface
for my client, and python funtionalities of the software.

- WHY Python

The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages.

- WHY QT designer

Qt Designer is the Qt tool for designing and building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Qt Widgets, so I can compose and customize my windows or dialogs in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) manner, and test them using different styles and resolutions.

- WHY Github

All scripts and documentation are stored in Github, making it easy to contribute to this open source projects, provide a clear documentation for the users, and showcase the project to our clients.

### Success Criteria
1. The software should be accessible from both phone and laptop
1. The software should have a function of tracking tasks
1. The software should have a function of sending notification when the deadline is approaching
1. The software should have a function of noteboard
1. The software should have a secured login system
1. The software should have a seperate page for club leader, club admin, and club members.
